      "Specialize on the highlighting system, which visually maps parsed products to their origin in source documents through coordinate mapping, DOM traversal, and string comparison",
      "Design and optimize text extraction algorithms and table parsing logic for complex document layouts, often handwritten, including side-by-side multi-table products within images, spreadsheets, and specialized formats like MSG, EML, and DOCX",
      "Enhance parsing accuracy through LLM prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and specialized logic for industry-specific products and jargon",
