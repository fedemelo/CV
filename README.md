# CV
Federico Melo Barrero's curriculum vitae [in the web](https://fedemelo.github.io/CV/).

If you're looking for my resume instead, you can find it [here](https://fedemelo.github.io/resume/).

## Tech Stack

Built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with an arguably unnecessary focus on modularization and separation of concerns. Bundled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and managed with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## Deployment

Deployment to GitHub Pages is manual but straightforward: `yarn deploy`.
